# Jest Testing Practice 🧪

A collection of utility functions built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to practice writing clean, reliable JavaScript code.

## 📝 About

This project focuses on the fundamentals of testing with **Jest**. The goal was to write the test cases first (defining expected behavior) and then implement the logic to pass those tests.

### Functions Implemented:

- **Capitalize:** Takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
- **Reverse String:** Takes a string and returns it reversed.
- **Calculator:** An object with basic arithmetic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `divide`, `multiply`).
- **Caesar Cipher:** Shifts each character in the string by a shift factor (handling wrapping from z to a).
- **Analyze Array:** Takes an array of numbers and returns an object with average, min, max, and length.

## 🛠️ Technologies
